# MCP Auth Proxy

## Overview

- **Drop-in OAuth 2.1/OIDC gateway for MCP servers â€” put it in front, no code changes.**
- **Your IdP, your choice**: Google, GitHub, or any OIDC provider â€” e.g. Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Keycloak â€” plus optional password.
- **Publish local MCP servers safely**: Supports all stdio, SSE, and HTTP transports. For stdio, traffic is converted to `/mcp`. For SSE/HTTP, itâ€™s proxied as-is. Of course, with authentication.
- **Verified across major MCP clients**: Claude, Claude Code, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc. â€” the proxy smooths client-specific quirks for consistent auth.

## Quickstart

> Domain binding & 80/443 must be accessible from outside.

Download binary from [release](https://github.com/sigbit/mcp-auth-proxy/releases) page.

If you use stdio transport

```sh
./mcp-auth-proxy \
  --external-url https://{your-domain} \
  --tls-accept-tos \
  --password changeme \
  -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ./
```

That's it! Your HTTP endpoint is now available at `https://{your-domain}/mcp`.

- stdio (when a command is specified): MCP endpoint is https://{your-domain}/mcp.
- SSE/HTTP (when a URL is specified): MCP endpoint uses the backendâ€™s original path (no conversion).

## Note

For a simpler approach to publish local MCP servers over OAuth, consider [MCP Warp](https://github.com/sigbit/mcp-warp), which provides an OAuth Proxy + ngrok-like service. We highly recommend considering this option as well.
